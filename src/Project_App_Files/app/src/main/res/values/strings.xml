        Professional Object Oriented Programmers was formed in late 2019\n in order to solve the crisis brought on by EC 327\'s final project.
        In\n response to this profound threat to everyone\'s GPAs, the members\n of this group decided to create a game named Aero Nav.\n
        The goal of Aero Nav was to fulfill all of the requirements set forth\n by the project assignment.\n
        This group elected to create a game meant for all ages in order to\n foster unity in our increasingly divided world.\n
        We hope we have succeeded, enjoy.\n
        \n
        Respectfully,\n
        \n
        P.O.O.P.\n
